The Hexagon Toolkit provides several libraries to build server applications. These libraries provide
single standalone features[^1] and are referred to as ["Ports"][Ports and Adapters Architecture].

The main ports are:

* [The HTTP server]: supports HTTPS, HTTP/2, mutual TLS, static files (serve and upload), forms
  processing, cookies, sessions, CORS and more.
* [The HTTP client]: which supports mutual TLS, HTTP/2, cookies, form fields and files among other
  features.
* [Template Processing]: allows template processing from URLs (local files, resources or HTTP
  content) binding name patterns to different engines.

Each of these features or ports may have different implementations called
["Adapters"][Ports and Adapters Architecture].

Hexagon is designed to fit in applications that conform to the [Hexagonal Architecture] (also called
[Clean Architecture], [Onion Architecture] or [Ports and Adapters Architecture]). Its design
principles also fit into this architecture.

[^1]: Except the Core module that contains a set of utilities like logging. However, some of these
capacities can be replaced by other third party libraries.

# Features
Hexagon's goals and design principles:

* **Put you in Charge**: There is no code generation, no runtime annotation processing, no classpath
  based logic, and no implicit behaviour. You control your tools, not the other way around.

* **Modular**: Each feature (Port) or adapter is isolated in its own module. Use only the modules
  you need without carrying unneeded dependencies.

* **Pluggable Adapters**: Every Port may have many implementations (Adapters) using different
  technologies. You can swap adapters without changing the application code.

* **Batteries Included**: It contains all the required pieces to make production-grade applications:
  logging utilities, serialization, resource handling and build helpers.

* **Kotlin First**: Take full advantage of Kotlin instead of just calling Java code from Kotlin. The
  library is coded in Kotlin for coding with Kotlin. No strings attached to Java (as a Language).

* **Properly Tested**: The project's coverage is checked in every Pull Request. It is also
  stress-tested at [TechEmpower Frameworks Benchmark][benchmark].

# Not in Scope
* **Kotlin Native**: because of the added complexity of Kotlin Native, focus will be set on the JVM
  platform, native binaries' generation will rely on GraalVM.

# Concepts

## Port
It is an interface for a task. The toolkit ports are designed to work on their own. For example: you
can use the [http_server] module without importing the [templates] one, and the other way around
(taking only the dependencies you need for your application).

Each Port may have different implementations (Adapters).

Ports cannot be used by themselves and in their place, an adapter implementing them should be added
to the list of dependencies.

## Adapter
They are implementations of a functionality (Port) for a given product/technology. Clients should
only use ports' code (not Adapters specific code), this makes them easy to switch among different
adapters with minimum impact.

Adapters are independent of each other, and you can use several adapters for the same port in a
single application. For example, you could use many Template adapters to support several template
engines.

[http_client_jetty], and [http_server_jetty] are examples of this type of module. Adapter names must
start with their Port name.

## Library
Module that provide functionality that does not depend on different implementations, like [core].
These modules can depend on several Ports, but never on Adapters. An example would be the [Web]
module that uses [http_server] and [template][Template Processing] Ports, but leaves clients the
decission of picking the adapters they want.

## Manager
Singleton object to manage a cross toolkit aspect. I.e., Serialization, Logging or Templates.

[core]: /core

[http_server]: /http_server
[templates]: /templates

[http_client_jetty]: /http_client_jetty
[http_server_jetty]: /http_server_jetty

# Hexagon Extras
The libraries inside the `hexagon_extra` repository provide extra features not bound to different
implementations (rely on ports to work). They will not use dependencies outside the Hexagon
toolkit.

* [Web]: this module is meant to ease web application development. Provides helpers for
  generating HTML and depends on the [HTTP Server] and [Templates] ports.
* [Schedulers]: Provides repeated tasks execution based on [Cron] expressions.
* [Models]: Contain classes that model common data objects.

[Web]: /web
[Schedulers]: /scheduler
[Models]: /models
[Cron]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron

# Architecture
How Hexagon fits in your architecture in a picture.

!!! Note
    Using this toolkit won't make your application compliant with Hexagonal Architecture (by its
    nature, no tool can do that), you have to provide a layer of abstraction by yourself.
